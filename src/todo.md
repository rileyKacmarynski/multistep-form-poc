# What are tough things we need to figure out?
- How to access and react to all other state
  - do logic base on that state
- query params
- validation
  - want to make sure everything is valid at the end
  - this might suck. rules depending on other form values might span steps
- figure out callbacks
  - can we expose hooks that we can pass a callback to?
  - need some way for a step to say what to do when moving onto the next step
- Need to be able to add or remove steps throughout the process
